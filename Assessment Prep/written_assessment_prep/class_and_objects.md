# Classes and Objects

## What are Classes? How do class and objects relate to each other?

Classes are like blueprints or basic outlines for objects. They define what the objects created from that class shall be made of i.e. attributes or characteristics and what actions they will be able to perform i.e. behaviours. Objects are created or instantiated from classes i.e. they are instances of a class. Classes can also be thought of as grouping common behavior.

Ruby has some built-in classes in its core library for example strings, integers, floats, arrays and hashes. But we can also create custom classes for real world objects e.g. we can have a class named `Cat` that groups common behaviours of all cats for example it could define a behavior called `jump` that all objects of the `Cat` class shall have. This class will also define what attributes these `Cat` objects shall have, e.g. name, color, age etc. Although the values of these attributes will be unique to each `Cat` object but all `Cat` objects shall have a `name`, `age` and `color` attribute. 

So essentially classes group common behaviours and objects encapsulate state.
