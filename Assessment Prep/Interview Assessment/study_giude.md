The interviewer will ask you to present or teach OOP topics.
  - work on the presentation skills

You should have a strong conceptual understanding of the core concepts in RB120

You should be able to talk about why they exist, and how to use them in code. 
  - write down explainations for why each concept in OOP exists and how to use them

You'll also need to use that conceptual understanding to reason with and solve various code examples and problems

We'll ask you to speak and drive the conversation, so practice speaking and teaching others on technical topics
  - Do all the written assessment questions twice. Explain the reasoning
  - Do all the easy 1 and easy 2 problems and debudding problems and explain your solution
  - Do all the questions in the 


 - Ruby Book
 - Written assessment
 - Modules

We will also assess your ability to communicate with clarity.

You should speak in a clear tone and explain concepts with precision and correct vocabulary. 

If you've never done this before, you should practice before the interview. 

When you make a mistake, we also want to see how you recover -- or whether you do at all.
