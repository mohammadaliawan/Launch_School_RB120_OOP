# Differences between Instance methods and class methods?
# Instance are used to access and manipulate instance level data
# class methods are used define behavior and data as pertains to the class rather than instances of the class.
# methods that need to deal with the state of objects can be defined as instance mehtods while method that don't can be defined as class methods.

# Instance
# - invoked by instances
# - generally used to deal with the state of objects or pertaining to objects
# - can access both instance and class variables
# - definition syntax
# - shared by all instances of class

# Class
# - invoked by classes
# - generally used for behavior unconcerned with object state and pertaining to class concerns.
# - can only access class variables
# - definition syntax (defined on class)
# - do not require object instantion to be called
