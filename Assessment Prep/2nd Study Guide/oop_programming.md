# Object Oriented Design

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs
2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods and classes/modules.
3. Do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code. Think about what states and behaviours each class is likely to have.
4. When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
