## What are Objects?

Objects in Ruby are anything that have a value e.g. strings, integers, arrays and hashes. They can represent real worls nouns as well. For example a cat, dog or a mouse.

Objects are created or instantiated from Classes. They are instances of a class. Each individual object will contain different information from other objects yet they are instances of the same class.
