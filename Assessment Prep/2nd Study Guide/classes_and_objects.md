# Classes and Objects

## What are Classes? How do class and objects relate to each other?

Objects are created from classes. 

Classes are like the basic outlines of what an object should be made of i.e. attributes and what it should be able to do i.e. behaviours.

In other words, Classes define the attributes and behaviours of the objects created from them. 

## What are Objects?

Objects in Ruby are anything that have a value e.g. strings, integers, arrays and hashes. They can also represent real worls nouns. For example a cat, dog or a mouse.

Objects are created or instantiated from Classes.

They are instances of a class. 

Each individual object will contain different information from other objects yet they are instances of the same class. 

## How are classes created?

```ruby
class GoodDog
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
```

In the above code, we created a class called `GoodDog` and instantiated a new object of the class `GoodDog` called `sparky`.

We have instantiated an object called `sparky` from the class `GoodDog`.
