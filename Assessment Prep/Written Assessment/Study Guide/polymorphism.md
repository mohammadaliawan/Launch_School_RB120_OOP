# Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to the ability of different object types to respond to the same method invocation in different ways.

In other words, data of different types can respond to a common interface.

When two or more object types have a method with the same name, we can invoke that method with any of those objects.

When we don't care what type of object is calling the method, we are using polymorphism.

## Two ways of implementing polymorphism

1. Inheritance
2. Duck Typing
