# Collaborators

Collaboration is a way of modeling the relationship between different objects. 

Objects that are stored as state in other objects are known as collaborator objects i.e. objects that are assigned the an object's instance variables.

Collaborator objects have an associative relationship with each other. It can be thought of as a 'has a' relationship. 

They are called collaborators because they work togather with the class that they are associated with. 

Collaborators play an important role in OO design because they represent the connections between different parts of the program. 

Collaborators help us to divide the problem into multiple smaller pieces. It then becomes easier to work on each smaller piece of the problem seperately and then bring togather all the pieces or modules that fit togather to solve the problem at hand. Collaborator objects help us to modularize the problem. 

__Q: What is a collaborator object, and what is the purpose of using collaborator objects in OOP?__

A collaborator object is an object that is stored as state within another object. As state is tracked by instance variables, this means that objects that are assigned to instance variables of an other object are known as collaborator objects. 

Collaboration is a way of modeling relationships between object types that have an associative relationship. That is, objects that work togather with each other. Collaborator objects can be thought of as having a 'has a' relationship. For example, a library has books, a team has members, a deck has cards etc.

Collaborator objects are an important aspect of OO design as they represent the connections between the various buidling blocks of the program. Collaborator objects allow us to breakdown the problem into smaller pieces and work on the smaller pieces seperately. This makes solving the smaller problem easier. And then bringing togather all the pieces or buidling blocks that fit togather to solve the problem at hand.
