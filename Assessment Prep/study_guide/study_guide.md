## Precision of Language

Some questions require that you explain code or concepts with words. It's important to explain how code works using precise vocabulary and to pinpoint the causal mechanism at work. In other words, use the right words and don't be vague.

In programming, we must always concern ourselves with outputs, return value, and object mutations. 

When writing answers to test questions, make sure you're as precise as possible, and that you use the proper vocabulary. Doing this helps you debug and understand more complex code later in your journey. If your definitions are imprecise, you can't use them to decompose a complicated method or program.

## Assessment Format

This assessment has a different style than the RB109 written assessment,so you should expect several open-ended questions where you will need to explain certain OOP concepts using code examples.
