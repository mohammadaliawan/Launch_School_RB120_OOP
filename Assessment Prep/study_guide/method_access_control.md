# Method Access Control


Access Control is about allowing or restricting access to a particular functionality or data in our code base.

Method access control is about restricting access to methods defined in a class. Method access control is implemented through the use of access modifiers.

In Ruby, Method Access Control is implemented through the use of `public`, `private`, `protected` access modifiers.

## Public Methods

Public methods are methods that are available for use to anyone who knows either the class name or object name. These methods are readily available for the rest of the program to use and comprise the class's interface.


All methods are public by default.

## Private methods

Methods that are performing some function inside a class but dont need to be available to rest of the program can be defined as private methods in a class.
